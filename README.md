# Best Practices example for an Angular Ticketing App

## Choices I made here:

- Use Nx
- Use Tailwind
- Use SCAMS and thin-app approach

## What I'd do if I spent more time on it:

- Avoid using numbers for id's
- Handle error states
- revise loading patterns
- persist data with localstore
- Add filtering and sorting to main ticket list
- Allow toggling status from list
